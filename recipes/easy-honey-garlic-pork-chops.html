    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 pork chops bone in or out</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water (or chicken broth)</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, or any white
        vinegar)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven broiler (or grill) on medium-high heat. Season chops with
        salt, pepper and garlic powder just before cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a pan or skillet over medium high heat until hot. Sear chops
        on both sides until golden and cooked through (about 4-5 minutes each
        side). Transfer to a plate; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium. Melt butter in the same pan, scraping up any
        browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Saut√© garlic until fragrant
        (about 30 seconds). Add the honey, water and vinegar. Increase heat to
        medium-high and continue to cook until the sauce reduces down and
        thickens slightly (about 3-4 minutes), while stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add pork back into the pan, baste generously with the sauce and
        broil/grill for 1-2 minutes, or until edges are slightly charred.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta or with a
        salad.
      </li>
    </ol>
