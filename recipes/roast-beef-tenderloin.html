      <li>5-6 pounds (2.5-3 kg) beef tenderloin, trimmed</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons coarse salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh cracked black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>4 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Red Wine Suace</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil</li>
      <li>1 onion (or brown shallots) finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (375 ml) dry red wine (Merlot or Pinot Noir)</li>
      <li>2 cups (500 ml) beef stock or broth</li>
      <li>1 sprig fresh thyme or rosemary</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Tenderloin</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice tenderloin in half crosswise to create 2 smaller roasts. If roast
        is untied, fold ends up against the centre/thicker part of each roast
        and tie with kitchen twine spaced about 1-inch apart. Make sure each
        halve is even in thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chill in the refrigerator, uncovered, for 12 hours (if time allows).
      </li>
      <li>Let beef stand at room temperature for 1-2 hours before roasting.</li>
      <li>
        Arrange oven rack to the middle of your oven and preheat to 430°F
        (220°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Season each beef tenderloin roast all over with salt and pepper. Heat
        the oil in an oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat until hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sear roasts on all four sides for about 3 minutes each side (about 12
        minutes total), turning with tongs until well browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine butter, garlic and Dijon (if using) together in a small bowl
        while roasts are searing. Set one half of the butter mixture aside to
        use later for the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slather remaining garlic butter over each roast (about 2 tablespoons
        each).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer skillet into the hot oven. (Alternatively: Transfer roast to a
        lightly greased roasting pan or baking dish.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part
        registers 120-125°F for medium rare (about 20-25 minutes). <br />
        *Or cook to your liking: <br />
        115-120°F for rare <br />
        130-135°F for medium <br />
        (Temperature will continue to rise about 5 degrees while the meat
        rests.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the roast to a carving board and let rest for 15 minutes. Keep
        the juices in the pan to make the sauce (see below).
      </li>
      <li>
        Carve the beef tenderloin into 1/2-inch-thick slices and serve the beef
        tenderloin with the optional red wine sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Skim fat off the remaining juices in the pan (if any).</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in the same pan with remaining pan juices over medium-high
        heat. Sauté onion for about 3 minutes until lightly browned and
        softened, scraping up any browned bits left from the beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add thyme/rosemary and season with pepper. Continue cooking for a
        further minute or so while stirring often.
      </li>
      <li>Pour in red wine and cook until reduced by half.</li>
      <li>
        Add in beef stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until
        reduced by half. Remove the sprig of thyme or rosemary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with salt to taste and whisk in reserved garlic butter. Pour in
        any juices left over from the resting steaks just before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
